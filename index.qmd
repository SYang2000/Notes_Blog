ðŸ‘‹ Hi â€” this is my running notebook on NLP/LLMs. I keep posts long-form and reference-heavy, with a table of contents on the right.

**Start here**:
- **Posts**: curated long reads and paper notes.
- **Archive**: all posts grouped by year.
- **Tags**: topic index.
- **FAQ**: meta and housekeeping.
